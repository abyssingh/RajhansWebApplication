    "Description": "First off - excellent tool - I now consider this a default install for any dev machine I use!\nÂ \nOne nice to have feature would be a \"Forward to SMTP Server\" - this would allow me (with out always tweaking the config settings on my apps when testing) to select specific emails that I am testing to push to a live SMTP server to see them actually delivered and in their \"natural\" environment. Big for me is formatting the email to make sure it looks right in many differnet inboxes (since outlook sucks at rendering HTML email....) - would just make life easier if this was a feature, thanks!",
