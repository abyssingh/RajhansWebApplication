Unfortunately I don't have access to a 64 bit Win 7 machine most of the time so this could be a few days away.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time if anybody could send me a network capture (wireshark etc) of the traffic between a client and SMTP4dev experiencing this issue then that will speed up my investigation. Since wireshark can't capture on the loopback interface, you'd have to do this between 2 machines.\r\n\r\nTo explain what the session log posted is showing. The last response apparently sent by the server is a 250 (OK) response, what should happen next is for the client to send a DATA request, but this doesn't seem to be happening. The few seconds of pause are the smtp client timeout waiting for the server to respond. Somehow either the 250 response isn't making it to the client, or the client isn't considering it to be a complete response.",
