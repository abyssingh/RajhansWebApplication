    "Description": "First things first - a very useful tool.\n \nFor me it would be useful to have a two pane layout with the existing main form as the left pane and the inspection form on the right.  Also à la Outlook, it would be good if new items could be appear at the top of the list.\n \nSlightly more of an ask: it would be great if it were a Visual Studio 2010 extension.\n \nThanks\n \nCrispin",
