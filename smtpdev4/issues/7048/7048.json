I've been aware of the CPU hogging problem for a while but unfortunately haven't had time to determine how to fix it.\r\nI'm working on a fix now and the next release should fix this problem.\r\n\r\nThe crashes are probably out of memory exceptions caused by the loop the program ends up in reading endless blank lines.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nRob",
