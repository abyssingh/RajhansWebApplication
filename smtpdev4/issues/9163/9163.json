    "Description": "The most common 'AUTH LOGIN' mechanism looks like this\n\n    S: 220 esmtp.example.com ESMTP\n    C: ehlo client.example.com\n    S: 250-esmtp.example.com\n    S: 250-PIPELINING\n    S: 250-8BITMIME\n    S: 250-SIZE 255555555\n    S: 250 AUTH LOGIN PLAIN CRAM-MD5\n    C: auth login\n    S: 334 VXNlcm5hbWU6\n    C: avlsdkfj\n    S: 334 UGFzc3dvcmQ6\n    C: lkajsdfvlj\n    S: 535 authentication failed (#5.7.1)\n\nFrom all the ESMTP Authentication mechanisms the offered, the client selects 'auth login'. The ESMTP server issues then a '334 VXNlcm5hbWU6' where 'VXNlcm5hbWU6' is a BASE64 encoded string 'Username:'. The client provides the BASE64 encoded user name and the sever responses with the request for the 'Password:' ('334 UGFzc3dvcmQ6'). In the sample above, random input is given and the server finally rejects the authentication request.\n\nHowever, there exists a different, RFC compliant version of this behavior, where the client initially sends the userid already with the AUTH LOGIN method:\n\n    C: AUTH LOGIN ZHVtbXk=\n    S: 334 UGFzc3dvcmQ6\n    C: Z2VoZWlt\n\nThe C# SmtpClient uses the latter and this authentication method is currently rejected by smtp4dev. \n\nAlso the C# SmtpClient uses lowercase 'login' instead of 'LOGIN' which is also not recognized by the current implementation of smtp4dev server (version 2.1.1.0) (nothing a simple ToUpper cannot solve).\n\nI have made some \"hacks\" to make this authentication work, but it would be better if these issues would be resolved in the trunk.\n\nHere's the authentication hack:\n```\npublic AuthMechanismProcessorStatus ProcessResponse(string data)\n{\n            if (State == States.Initial && !String.IsNullOrEmpty(data))\n            {\n                State = States.WaitingForUsername;\n            }\n\n```",
