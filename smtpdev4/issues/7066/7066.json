    "Description": "This error just started on Friday.  For some odd reason, the program no longer sends my emails.  I have been using this program flawlessly forever and now it stopped working.  My code is standard issue:\n \nSmtpClient smtp = new SmtpClient(\"127.0.0.1\");\nsmtp.Port = 25;\nsmtp.UseDefaultCredentials = true;\nsmtp.Send(msg);\n \nErrors saying \"failure sending email\" and \"unable to connect to remote server\"\n \nRemote server is localhost!  It always has been.  Please help.  I use this program like it's water, vital to my very survival.\n \nWin 7 Professional.  VS 2008/2010",

I knew there was no way this program was the cause as it had been working just peachy for so long.  it's definitely a lifesaver.\r\n\r\nSorry to have wasted your time.",
