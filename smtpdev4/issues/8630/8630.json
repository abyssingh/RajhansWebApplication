    "Description": "I downloaded the source code of smtp4dev 2.0.9 and playing around with the Rnwood.SmtpServer to see if I can embed it in a custom server. In my server, I register only the Rnwood.SmtpServer.Extensions.SizeExtension.  When I send a message using Mozilla Thunderbird, the transaction fails and Thunderbird says that the server responds with just \"SIZE\". In my case, server ends up in an infinite loop.\n\nSo, I debug using a telnet session to the server:\n\n```\nTrying 127.0.0.1...\nConnected to goten.local.\nEscape character is '^]'.\n220 (none) smtp4dev ready\nEHLO example.com\n250 Nice to meet you.\nSIZE\n```\n\nThis is where I notice that the server responded incorrectly, so I sent the QUIT command back to the server and the everything closed correctly.\n\n```\nQUIT\n221 See you later aligator\nConnection closed by foreign host.\n\n```\n\nIf I am interpreting  [RFC 1869](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1869) correctly, I think each line of the EHLO response is suppose start with a \"250\" code:\n\n```\nehlo-ok-rsp  ::=     \"250\"    domain [ SP greeting ] CR LF\n                    / (    \"250-\"   domain [ SP greeting ] CR LF\n                        *( \"250-\"      ehlo-line           CR LF )\n                           \"250\"    SP ehlo-line           CR LF   )\n```\n\nI think this is a bug. Any thoughts?\n\nThanks,\nRalph",
