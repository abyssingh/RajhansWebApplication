This makes only usable for local development environment (because RDPing to staging every time is a bad option for us).\r<br />\nWe'd like to use it on staging and setup a separate web-app to see which emails have been sent by our Staging.\r<br />\nSimple ASP.NET app would be sufficient.\r<br />\nThanks.<br />\n",
