    "Html": "Will SMTP4Dev work on Windows 8 machines? <br />\n\r<br />\nJust wondering because the Download description doesn't say anything about Windows 8.  I did download it and it seems to come up fine.  But when I run the program that my buddy runs on his Windows 7 machine, his works but mine doesn't.  Not sure if it's something on Windows 8 that is blocking access or if SMTP4dev doesn't work.  I get the following exception:\r<br />\n<br />\njavax.mail.MessagingException: Could not connect to SMTP host: localhost, port: 25;\r<br />\n  nested exception is:\r<br />\njava.net.ConnectException: connect: Address is invalid on local machine, or port is not valid on remote machine<br />\n",
