The crash is causes by smtp4dev trying to establish an SSL session without having a configured SSL certificate.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to use SSL you need to provide a SSL certificate that your SMTP client will trust - just configure that in the options screen and the crash should stop happening.</p>\r\n<p>I'm opening a work item to fix this properly.</p>",
